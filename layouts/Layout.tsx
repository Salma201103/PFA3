// Define Props interface to specify the type of props expected by the component
// In TypeScript, interfaces are used to define the structure of objects, including the props passed to React components.
// Here, we're defining an interface named Props. It has one property called "children", which is expected to be of type React.ReactNode.
// React.ReactNode is a type that represents any valid JSX expression, such as JSX elements, strings, or fragments.
interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode; // The children prop allows the component to render its child components or elements
